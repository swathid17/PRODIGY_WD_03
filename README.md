# PRODIGY_WD_03 - Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

This project was developed as part of the Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The goal of Task 03 is to create a browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Task Description:

The Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application enables users to:

- Play the classic 3x3 grid game
- Compete against another player or potentially an AI
- Track the game state and determine winning conditions
- Restart the game and keep the interface interactive and responsive

Technologies Used:

- HTML – For structuring the game board
- CSS – For styling and responsive layout
- JavaScript – For game logic, turn tracking, and win condition detection

Features:

- Interactive game board
- Turn-based play (X and O)
- Win/tie detection
- Game reset functionality

What I Learned:

- Implementing dynamic UI updates using JavaScript
- Handling user interactions through event listeners
- Designing conditional logic for turn switching and win conditions
- Enhancing UX using CSS transitions and hover effects
